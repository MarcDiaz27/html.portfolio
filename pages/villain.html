			To pass the time during a boring shift, Squidward freaks out SpongeBob with the story of a murderous, undead fry cook. Dubbed the Hash-Slinging Slasher, this killer's weapon of choice is a rusty spatula - where his hand used to be. If that doesn't scare you, he also arrives with eerie lighting, a ringing phone without a caller, and the ghost of the bus that ran him over. Though the Slasher is completely made-up, it's horrifying when what seems to be his spitting image appears outside the Krusty Krab. His glowing red eyes and some creepy spatula tapping add to the terror. While the lookalike turns out to just be a friendly cook, the legend 
				of the Hash-Slinging Slasher elicits enough dread to feel real and earns it a spot on our list.</p>

			<p>A vengeance-seeking serial killer who chokes people to death is a violent image for a 
				children's show. It's this bloodthirsty reputation and an established history of 
				murder that sets the Tattle-Tale Strangler apart from other criminals in Bikini Bottom. 
				After SpongeBob gets him arrested, the Strangler attempts to lure our hero to his doom 
				without being seen. His poster is enough to send tough guys running in fear, especially 
				given how much pleasure he appears to take in strangling. It's only his own fright at SpongeBob's insane behavior that prevents him from another kill. But as some wanted posters point out in later episodes, the Tattle-Tale Strangler
				 continues hurting people long after he meets SpongeBob, making him an enduring threat.</p>
